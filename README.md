# un-shell
### What is this?
- Currently, nothing. The idea behind this, is to unify many diffrent speratic cybersecurity tools and provide a simplistic way to access them.

### What should this do?
- For example, if you needed to pivot between computers, no need to mess with `iptables` or tor. You should simply just route traffic on the other end of a network.
- If you need to run NMAP on a remote server, you should be able to stream the binary over, while it is executing to limit AVs from detecting the binary on the disk.
- If you need to run a series of commands at a moment's notice, you should be able to do so in a flexible way.
- If you want to be pinged on your phone, the moment a server goes offline
